# 📊 Statistics Roadmap for Data Analytics & Data Science

This roadmap represents **my personal study journey in Statistics**, created while preparing for **Data Analytics and Data Science**.  
All topics listed here are based on **handwritten notes, academic learning, and practical understanding**, not copied from random online sources.

I am using this roadmap to:
- Build strong statistical foundations
- Revise concepts systematically
- Maintain well-structured notes on GitHub as I learn and grow

---

## 1️⃣ Introduction to Statistics
This section covers the **basic building blocks of statistics**, helping to understand why statistics is important in data analysis.

- What is Statistics
- Types of Statistics: Descriptive & Inferential
- Types of Data
- Population and Sample
- Sampling Techniques
- Statistical Data Analysis Steps

---

## 2️⃣ Descriptive Statistics
Focused on **summarizing and understanding data**, this section explains how data behaves and how insights are derived.

- Measures of Central Tendency  
  - Mean  
  - Median  
  - Mode
- Measures of Dispersion  
  - Range  
  - Variance  
  - Standard Deviation  
  - Percentiles & Quartiles
- Graphical Representations  
  - Histogram  
  - Boxplot  
  - Scatter Plot
- Outliers and their Impact
- Correlation & Covariance

---

## 3️⃣ Probability
This section builds the **foundation for uncertainty and randomness**, which is essential for predictive analytics.

- Basic Probability Concepts  
  - Sample Space  
  - Events
- Types of Events  
  - Disjoint & Non-Disjoint  
  - Independent & Dependent
- Complement of Probability
- Conditional Probability
- Bayes Theorem
- Probability Distribution

---

## 4️⃣ Random Variables & Probability Distributions
Here, probability concepts are extended to **random variables and real-world data distributions**.

- Random Variables  
  - Discrete  
  - Continuous
- Probability Mass Function (PMF)
- Probability Density Function (PDF)
- Discrete Distributions  
  - Bernoulli Distribution  
  - Binomial Distribution
- Continuous Distributions  
  - Uniform Distribution  
  - Normal Distribution
- Standard Normal Distribution
- Standardization vs Normalization
- Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 Rule)

---

## 5️⃣ Inferential Statistics
This section focuses on **drawing conclusions from data** and making data-driven decisions.

- Relationship with Descriptive Statistics
- Point Estimation & Interval Estimation
- Confidence Intervals  
  - Z-distribution  
  - T-distribution
- Hypothesis Testing  
  - Null & Alternative Hypothesis  
  - Level of Significance  
  - p-value
- Types of Errors  
  - Type I Error  
  - Type II Error
- One-tailed & Two-tailed Tests
- Statistical Tests  
  - Z-test  
  - T-test  
  - ANOVA  
  - Chi-Square Test

📌 **Note:**  
This roadmap is **actively followed** while creating topic-wise notes, explanations, and examples in this repository.  
The content will grow gradually as I continue learning and revising statistics for real-world data analytics use cases.
