# 📘 Introduction to Statistics

These notes are prepared from my **personal handwritten study material** while learning *Statistics for Data Analytics & Data Science*.  
The objective of this section is to build **conceptual clarity** before moving to formulas, numerical problems, and real-world datasets.

## 🔹 What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the process of:

- Collecting data  
- Analyzing data  
- Interpreting results  
- Drawing conclusions for decision-making  

In simple words, statistics helps us **understand data and make sense out of it**.

### 🔸 Examples:
- Average marks scored by students in an exam  
- Monthly sales performance of a company  
- Probability that two people in a room share the same birthday  

---

## 🔹 Types of Statistics

Statistics is broadly divided into **two main branches**:

---

### 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics mainly involves:

- Collection of data  
- Analysis of data  
- Interpretation of data  

**Primary Goal:**  
👉 To understand the **main features of data**

Descriptive statistics focuses on **organizing and summarizing data**, using:

- Tables and graphs  
- Descriptive measures (tools)

**Common tools used:**
- **Measures of Central Tendency**
  - Mean  
  - Median  
  - Mode  
- **Measures of Variation (spread of data)**
  - Range  
  - Variance  
  - Standard Deviation  
- **Percentiles**
- Graphical representations  
  - Histogram  
  - Boxplot  
  - Scatter plot  

---

### 2️⃣ Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics is about **drawing conclusions from a sample** and applying them to a **larger population**.

In simple terms, it means:
- Studying a small portion of data (sample)
- Making educated guesses or predictions about the entire population

It helps us:
- Predict outcomes  
- Understand relationships  
- Make decisions even when full data is not available  

📌 **Example:**  
If we survey a few people about their favourite fruit, we can infer the favourite fruit of the entire population.

---

## 🔹 Data

**Data** is raw information collected from different sources.  
It can exist in the form of:

- Numbers  
- Text  
- Facts  

👉 Analyzing data helps in **making informed decisions and drawing conclusions**.

---

## 🔹 Types of Data

### 1️⃣ Based on Structure

**Structured Data**
- Tables  
- Spreadsheets  
- Relational databases  

**Unstructured Data**
- Images  
- Audio / Video  
- Emails  
- Blogs and web content  

---

### 2️⃣ Based on Time

**Cross-Sectional Data**
- Data collected at a **single point in time**  
- Example: Survey conducted on a particular date  

**Time Series Data**
- Data collected over a **sequence of time intervals**  
- Examples:
  - Daily or monthly stock prices  
  - Monthly sales data  

---

### 3️⃣ Based on Number of Variables

- **Univariate Data** – Single variable  
- **Multivariate Data** – Two or more variables  

---

## 🔹 Types of Variables

### 1️⃣ Nominal
- Categories without any specific order  
- Example: Gender, Colours  

### 2️⃣ Ordinal
- Categories with a specific order  
- No fixed or uniform difference between them  
- Example:
  - Education level  
  - Customer ratings  

### 3️⃣ Numerical
- Data represented in numbers  
- Example: Age, Height, Price  

### 4️⃣ Interval
- Meaningful intervals but **no true zero**  
- Example: Temperature, IQ  

### 5️⃣ Ratio
- True zero exists  
- Ratios are meaningful  
- Example: Height, Weight  

---

## 🔹 Population and Sample

**Population**
- Entire group we want to draw conclusions about  
- Examples:
  - Residents of a country  
  - Customers of a company  

**Sample**
- Smaller group selected from the population  
- Used to represent the population  

📌 A good sample should be:
- Random  
- Large enough  
- Reliable  

---

## 🔹 Why Sample?

Sampling is used:
- To reduce the cost of data collection  
- When full population data (census) is not possible  
- To save time and resources  

---

## 🔹 Sampling Techniques

There are **four main sampling techniques**:

### 1️⃣ Random Sampling
- Every individual has an equal chance of selection  
- Simple and unbiased  

---

### 2️⃣ Stratified Sampling
- Population divided into groups (strata)  
- Samples selected from each group  
- Ensures proper representation  

---

### 3️⃣ Systematic Sampling
- Selecting every *n-th* individual from a list  
- Example: Selecting every 3rd person  

---

### 4️⃣ Cluster Sampling
- Population divided into clusters  
- Entire clusters are randomly selected  

---

## 🔹 Statistical Data Analysis Steps

1. Define the problem or research question  
2. Data collection  
3. Data cleaning  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Data transformation  
6. Hypothesis formulation  
7. Statistical testing  
8. Interpretation of results  
9. Drawing conclusions  
10. Document the Analysis Process
